# A fragment represents possible combinations for a part of the path. The first/top
# fragment represents the first "part" of a path.
#
# The fragment contains the possible static parts or a single dynamic part
# Each static part or dynamic part has another fragment, that represents the
# next set of fragments that could match. This is a bit confusing so let's dive
# into an example:
#
#  * `/users/foo`
#  * `/users/:id`
#  * `/posts/foo`
#
# The Fragment would represent the possible combinations for the first part
#
# ```
# # 'nil' because there is no route with a dynamic part in the first slot
# fragment.dynamic_part # nil
#
# # This returns a Hash whose keys are the possible values, and a value for the
# *next* Fragment
# fragment.static_parts
#
# # Would return:
# {"users" => Fragment, "posts" => Fragment}
#
# # The Fragment in the 'users' key would have:
#
# # Fragment.new(PathPart(":id"))
# fragment.dynamic_part
#
# # Static parts
# fragment.static_parts
# {"foo" => Fragment}
# ```
#
# ## Gotcha
#
# The last fragment of a path is "empty". It does not have static parts or
# dynamic parts
